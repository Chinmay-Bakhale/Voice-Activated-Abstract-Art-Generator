# Voice-Activated Abstract Art Generator

This project combines real-time audio analysis with generative art techniques to create dynamic abstract art based on audio features like tempo, pitch, and sentiment.

## Overview

- **Audio Analysis**: Uses openSMILE for feature extraction.
- **Art Generation**: Employs Stable Diffusion with optional LoRA fine-tuning for enhanced art quality.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, PyAudio, sounddevice, transformers, diffusers, torch.

## Features

- **Real-Time Feedback Loop**: Dynamically adjusts art parameters based on audio inputs.
- **Fine-Tuning with LoRA**: Enhances model performance for abstract art generation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries using `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `main.ipynb` notebook to test the project.
